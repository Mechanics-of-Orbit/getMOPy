title: What's MOPy?
---

[MOPy](https://mechanics-of-orbit.github.io/MOPy) is an open-source learning tool to learn Orbital Mechanics. It is developed with the purpose of introducing the core concepts of Orbital Mechanics. MOPy uses an interactive UI with tool tips and a 3D Environment with an interactive virtual universe. The 3D Environment helps the learner to visualize the concepts in a much more accessible and easier way.
