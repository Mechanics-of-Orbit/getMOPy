title: Introducing MOPy
---

[MOPy](https://mechanics-of-orbit.github.io/MOPy) an open source project on an application which is a learning tool for Orbital Mechanics. If you want to contribute to the project application or if you wish to try out the application and help us with developing the project check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mechanics-of-Orbit/MOPy)

## Language used

We used python to develop this application. There are many reasons we used python as the programming language. The main one being that anyone with little to no experience in programming or coding in general can understand the syntax easily. Anyone can start learning the language and start messing around with it to understand how it works. 

Secondaly there are many robust standard libraries which makes the work a little bit more eaiser. Of course, down the line we do intend to make MOPy a library.

And last but not least Python is the most versitle of the bunch. Once we plan to develop to multiple platform platforms we don't have to switch languages, from developing a web application(which would negate the of a moderatly modern computer and let anyone open through the browser) to developing a full fledged multi-platform application python can be used as the primary language, which would greatly help in focusing more on the module than on the actual progamming itself.

## Why did we develop MOPy?

The growth in space industry is growing, a projection from Morgan Stanley projects that the space industry would generate about USD 1 Trillion by 2040[[1]](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space), and in India it is projected that the revenue will be about 1% of the entire GDP which accounts to USD 50 Billion by 2024 from the current USD 7 Billion[[2]](https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/research-insights/2020/preparing-to-scale-new-heights.pdf). With this being the case many students are showing interest to learn more and more about space technology and its related concepts.

Considering such possibilities, we have come up with an idea to develop a learning tool beneficial to learn more about Orbital Mechanics in a much more eaiserand accessible way.

Unlike other applications, here a user can start with no prior knowledge of Orbital Mechanics and start learning the basic concepts and apply it.Â Whereas in other applications require the user to have a minimum knowledge in the field of space mechanics.

Thanks!
